# Algorithms
============================================================================

I am fascinated by the change that Deep Learing is bringing out in the world. To be a good DL Engineer I have to master object oriented programming and algorithms. After all, an MLE/DLE is a **software engineer** working in the domain of beautiful NN architectures!

Here I try to work of refining my algorithmic thinking. I take it as a challenge not only to improve the way I think, but to also enhance my skills as a potential Deep Learning Engineer. I'll be primarily using C++ to achieve this goal.

Thank you for reading this! Have a great day.
